## emi_S1_O9_d-54.dat
From Roland Vanderspek. Earth/Moon interference table for S1.  Gives angular and physical distance of Earth and Moon from the boresights of the four cameras as a function of five different time standards.  Likely best used to estimate brightness of blob.

## emangles_S1_O9_d-54.dat
From Roland Vanderspek. Earth/Moon interference table for S1.  Gives  elevation above sunshade, azimuth around S/C axis, and distance for Earth and Moon as a function of five different time standards.  Likely best to localize the blob in FOV.
